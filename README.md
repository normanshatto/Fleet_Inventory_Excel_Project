Excel Fleet Inventory Project

Author: Norman Shatto
Tools used: Excel

Project Overview: 

This project simulates a data analyst who has been tasked with sorting and analyzing fleet inventory data. The plan is to clean the data and create pivot tables to analyze in preparation for the results to be visualized in a dashboard. 

The raw data was provided in a CSV file and was imported into Excel to clean and analyze. I have uploaded the original CSV file that I was given to clean and analyze, and the final XLSX file I created, which includes the refined version with pivot tables.
